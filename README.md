# Algorithms
Repository for Algorithms class
## Current Algorithm Projects in File
There are three current test algorithms for demonstrating
the understanding of three concepts:  \
Constant: O(1)  \
Linear: O(n)  \
Quadratic: O(n^2)  \
All of these projects are coded in C#(default)  \
The program files can be found in the BigO folder.  \
All of the example programs are in the cs file 'Program.cs'  \

The Roguelike file contains the code for the PlayerController  \
and the EnemyController. Both of these are for Unity ver 2021.1.23f1  \
or later and require both a player and enemy object with Rigidbody2D to run.  \

The Fisher-Yates Algorithm sorts an array of strings spelling out the word  \
'Algorithms'. The array can be of anything since its an obj rather than any  \
specific parameter such as string or int.
