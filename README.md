## Current Algorithm Projects in File
There are three current test algorithms for demonstrating
the understanding of three concepts:  \
Constant: O(1)  \
Linear: O(n)  \
Quadratic: O(n^2)  \
All of these projects are coded in C#(default)  \
The program files can be found in the BigO folder.  \
All of the example programs are in the cs file 'Program.cs'
